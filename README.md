graphical text data files to KML/shape file conversion
What is a GXT file?
<br />
A GXT file contains textual data in GXT format that describes one or more diagrams of Earth-orbiting satellite networks. It is typically imported and exported by Graphical Interference Management System (GIMS) users to share diagram data. GXT files also store metadata, which includes the GXT format version, name of the satellite network, the number of diagrams described in the GXT file, and the satellite nominal orbital longitude.
<br />
# Why this code matters ?
<br />
Typical way opening GXT files are GIMS software by ITU. However graphics from the software can be basic. Therefore this code can produce kml for nicer representation of these data on google earth, QGIS or ArcMap.
